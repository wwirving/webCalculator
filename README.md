webCalculator is a digital calculator application build using HTML, CSS and JS.

CODE 

Building the calculator was the first project in which I made use of bubbling/event propogation to collect onClick events within the calculator body and then parsing the values within a switch block. The approach to logic was functional, and a good introduction to design allowances in terms of limiting user input to only one multiplication/division since the main sum function does not support order of operations. Once the basic build was deployed, then end to end testing was completed with Cypress - checking for correct outputs and expected CSS styling and transitions. 

DESIGN

The calculator features 4 different coloured skins, which can be browsed through by clicking on the frame. The font used is Basteleur.
